        Welcome to my Project for Alura (challenge/sprint), in which I will be updating, documenting, and fixing this project (bugs, features, etc).

### The idea is to apply what I have learned in previous courses and put it into practice through this project. Here is the template/design of how the page should look:(https://www.figma.com/file/NUd563IRcuwUGyFGTwPP5W/AluraGeek?type=design&node-id=1-315&t=xOSn4PUnxhuJOgNv-0)

### Later on, I will be changing the design and colors, customizing them to my liking and the way I develop in this project.

### I hope you like it, and it would help me a lot if you give a star to this repository.
